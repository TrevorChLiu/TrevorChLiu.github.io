I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Melbourne, and I also completed a semester-long exchange program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I have a strong interest in machine learning and have conducted research on applying reinforcement learning to reduce traffic congestion caused by autonomous vehicle empty cruising. Beyond academics, I have strengthened my practical skills through internship experience.
