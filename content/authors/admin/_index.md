      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Melbourne, and I also completed a semester-long exchange program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I have a strong interest in machine learning and have conducted research on applying reinforcement learning to reduce traffic congestion caused by autonomous vehicle empty cruising. Beyond academics, I have strengthened my practical skills through internship experience.
